## Hi there 👋

Student developer studying frontend development with a strong interest in application security.

I focus on building user-friendly web interfaces using JavaScript and React,  
while also learning how security vulnerabilities arise and how to prevent them through secure coding and proper design.

My goal is to grow as a developer who understands both how to build systems and how to protect them.
